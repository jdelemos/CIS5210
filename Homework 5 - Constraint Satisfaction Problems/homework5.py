#     3 points] In this section, we will view a Sudoku puzzle not from the perspective of its grid
# layout, but more abstractly as a collection of cells. Accordingly, we will represent it internally
# as a dictionary mapping from cells, i.e. (row, column) pairs, to sets of possible values. This
# dictionary should have a fixed (9 Ã— 9 = 81) set of pairs of keys, but the number of elements in
# each set corresponding to a key will change as the board is being manipulated.
# In the Sudoku class, write an initialization method __init__(self, board) that stores such a
# mapping for future use. Also write a method get_values(self, cell) that returns the set of
# values currently available at a particular cell.
# In addition, write a function read_board(path) that reads the board specified by the file at
# the given path and returns it as a dictionary. Sudoku puzzles will be represented textually as 9
# lines of 9 characters each, corresponding to the rows of the board, where a digit between "1"
# and "9" denotes a cell containing a fixed value, and an asterisk "*" denotes a blank cell that
# could contain any digit.
